0E27CB56: Nobody wants to back a loser and no sponsor is going to throw good bank after bad. You wanna keep getting paid, you gotta keep winning. Go out there and make an impression.
0E27CB57: I got some deals working on the back burner. I've been talking to some other sponsors who may be willing to drop some serious bank if they can find a winner. What do you say you impress them with a win?
0E27CB58: It's like this dude - winnin' means bank and big bank comes from sponsor's.  This straight line burn is gonna count large against your contract.  So max impress out there.
0E27CB59: Second counts as first place loser and sponsor's donüt kick it with losers.  This roadtop sprint is worth more than just brownies for your current deal.  This race is gonna seed the ground for future deals so ya got to come in big.

4C22CEE9: Word on the street is your last win here was just a fluke. Nobody's taking you seriously yet. Let's show these jokers who's boss and get the heck out of here before the heat gets wise.
4C22CEEA: Win tonight and sponsors will really start taking notice. You haven't exactly faced the toughest competition but win this one and you'll increase your chances of getting invited back. Don't screw it up.
4C22CEEB: Competition here is stiff. It's one thing to win on the street, it's something completely different to win on a real track. URL races separate the contenders from the pretenders.
4C22CEEC: URL racing is the bomb. Only the best get invited to race these tracks and skill is king. There aren't gonna be any lucky wins because someone gets accidentally clipped by Grandma's station wagon.
4C22CEED: Hey man you need to stay sharp for this race. URL is the best of the best and these guys have mad skillz. You're going up against some of the best racers in the city, so stay sharp.
4C22CEEE: Yo dog, you're gonna face some stiff competition on the track tonight. Some of these guys don't exactly play fair and they'd just as soon run over you as go around you. Pick a good line and stay alert and you should make it to the finish.
4C22CEEF: These guys are fa real.  Aint no time to think - just do.  The curves and burns these guys can pull are off the hook so stay on top.  People still aint impressed by you so you best go hard.
4C22CEF0: You better pull it tight cause these cats are gonna get you fully bent if you don't. They run with the top and this is your chance to squeeze in. No time for frontin' so roll out mad and pull what'cha got to.

6B234B69: Oooh, look at the newbie. Let me make this easy for you. Give your bank to the starter and try not to get in anybody's way. I don't want you screwing up my beat down on these other fools.
6B234B6A: Whoa dog, you ain't seriously thinking about bringin' that heap into this race are you? I don't want to risk my win because I have to avoid your sad ride when I lap you. Pay attention to the map and stay out of my way.
6B234B6B: You ready to saddle up for this run, dog? Whoa - you know I'm talking about your car, not real horses, right? I always forget that you're from the sticks. Sorry dog.
6B234B6C: Sup mutt? Since I'm gonna be taking all of your Benjamins, you can call me Bank. You deposit enough in my wallet and maybe I'll give you a free toaster. You ready to start an account?
6B234B6D: Yo dude, the other drivers wanted me to tell you that there are no garbage trucks allowed in this race. We figured it had to be from the city 'cause ain't nobody gonna get caught racing a heap like that.
6B234B6E: You wanna run in this one, you better bring it real...and your sled better ride like it's on rails 'cause we ain't playing. I'll take your bank just the same as the next chump. You in?
6B234B6F: If you wanna run with us you better bring your best stuff. I don't think that ride you're driving has got enough to make it to the start line, let alone all the way to the finish line. You might want to think about this one.
6B234B70: Alright - looks like we've got a taker. If your bank is good then roll up to the line. We've been known to take on some charity cases occassionally and it looks like you'll fit the bill just fine.

8718DD0B: Since Street X is a pretty new event, only the winners will attract the big bucks from the sponsors. The first person to make a name for themselves doing this could be in for a big payday.
8718DD0C: Hey dog, this one's to knock off one of your obligations to the sponsors. They got some people out here to see how you drive so don't do anything stupid. We win here and we get paid.
8718DD0D: Buzz is building on the new kid in town. I might be able to get some sweet deals lined up for the future if you keep winning. Let's give the sponsors something to get excited about.
8718DD0E: Bro, sponsors back winners. Winners sell products to kids. Winners get paid. We need to get paid so go out there and win.
8718DD0F: It's like this dawg.  No one knows what to expect from the street X so it's your chance to shine.  Rack it up into first place and the sponsor's will take notice.  Notice means bank and that means a better ride.
8718DD10: No time to stunt. Tonight's the night to prove to these cats you ain't no hillbilly. Top the race and the bank will start to flow. Do what'cha know ya need to.
8718DD11: Fix it right in the cross and the big timers will have to take note.  Exposure like that breeds bank and we all know you can use it.
8718DD12: Ay yo trip!  It's the big daddy street cross comin' at'cha.  Kick it into the top spot and the shirt tucks will dig it.  A deal will be sure to follow from them.
8718DD13: It don't ever look like much, but be clear...ya disrespect the X and it will get you fully bent. Just do what'cha know and roll 'er in first. The rest will follow.

8809CAD3: Alright, another quick payday if you can negotiate this run. Win this and you're one step closer to closing out your contract. Let's see what you've got.
8809CAD4: You need this win. A little birdie told me that the sponsor is watching this run. Wrap this one up so we can keep gettin' paid.
8809CAD5: Nobody wants to back a loser and no sponsor is going to throw good bank after bad. You wanna keep getting paid, you gotta keep winning. Go out there and make an impression.
8809CAD6: Look here dude.  Ya got to scorch the clay and top the drag cause this race is written into your deal.  You have to win to keep the sponsor's from second guessing their choice.  I'll be watchin' from the end zone.
8809CAD7: Yo boy, tonights drag will get you gravy if you pull first.  A win checks against your deal and scores you some C's.  You happy, me happy and sponsor's happy.
8809CAD8: Don't sweat it, but this drag ain't no ordinary run. It registers against your sponsor deal and wins ya some bank. Ya pull this off on top and ya got one less thing to worry about - except bank.
8809CAD9: It's goin' down tonight. Sponsors want a win and you need the bank.  Ball into first and scratch another race in the win column of your contract. Winnin' gets deals and deals get you the lime light. Go big!

CC3D71E9: Launch is followed by shift so it
CC3D7202: If the other guy gets past you - just chill and slide into his slipstream and sit in his draft.  Gain precious speed and then make your move to bounce right on by.

CC3D726B: Now that you know what you are doing, just jam the throttle to the floor and go BIGGGG!  See ya at the base.
